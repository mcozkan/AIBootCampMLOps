        Story of the DataSet:

Nowadays, network systems play a critical role in all areas, from banking to education, and from healthcare to government institutions. However, these systems have become more vulnerable to cyberattacks than ever before. As a result, intrusion detection has become one of the most important components of cybersecurity.

The UNSW-NB15 dataset was created to enable researchers and developers to design intrusion detection algorithms based on network traffic that closely resembles real-world conditions.

Who Created It?

The dataset was generated by the Cyber Range Lab at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia.
The IXIA PerfectStorm simulator was used for data generation.
The dataset was created in 2015 and is still frequently used in academic publications today.
How Was the Data Collected?

To create realistic network traffic, both normal user behaviors and cyberattacks were simulated. The simulations were run at different times and on different days to generate data spread across various time periods. Network traffic data was collected to include both normal connections and nine different types of attacks.""")
